# rotated-heads-oddball

## Background

This is a [lab.js](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) rendering of [Begleiter et al's (1984)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6474187/) two-stimulus rotated-heads oddball task. Target stimuli (stylized "heads" with a triangle "nose" and one "ear") should generate larger event-related potentials (ERPs) than non-target stimuli (circles).
