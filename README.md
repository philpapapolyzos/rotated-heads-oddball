# rotated-heads-oddball

## background
This is a [lab.js](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) rendering of Begleiter et al's (1984) two-stimulus rotated-heads oddball task. Target stimuli (stylized "heads" with a triangle "nose" and one "ear") should generate larger event-related potentials (ERPs) than non-target stimuli (circles).
